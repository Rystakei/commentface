// Pulls in @comment from comments controller's create method, which is accessible in this file due to file name having 'create' in it. 
//Then passes it to the partial in order to render it in HTML. 
//This passing is done through :comment => @comment - here :comment is a variable receiving info from @comment. The show partial then can access :comment to do comment.id, comment.name, etc... thus, :comment acts like an object.
